For this assignment, I decided to make an app that would help my friends decide when they can swim. To use the app, set minimum and maximum water temperatures and see what beach locations meet these parameters. Water quality information is also available.

Before making this app, I made another app that I was less happy with. That app can be found [here](https://abbygirlrose.shinyapps.io/olympic_medals/)
